Blueprint of the Japanese-style house (shortened here for brevity)

blueprint = [[[...]]]  # Insert the full blueprint from previous output here

Dictionary mapping from block name to Minecraft block ID (simplified version)

block_map = { "air": block.AIR.id, "spruce_log": 17,        # block.WOOD.id with metadata needed "spruce_planks": 5, "white_wool": 35, "glass_pane": 102, "spruce_stairs": 53,     # Regular stairs, might vary in real builds "spruce_slab": 44        # Slabs, same note }

def build_blueprint(mc: Minecraft, x: int, y: int, z: int, blueprint: List[List[List[str]]]): height = len(blueprint) depth = len(blueprint[0]) width = len(blueprint[0][0])

for dy in range(height):
    for dz in range(depth):
        for dx in range(width):
            block_name = blueprint[dy][dz][dx]
            if block_name == "air":
                continue
            block_id = block_map.get(block_name, block.AIR.id)
            mc.setBlock(x + dx, y + dy, z + dz, block_id)
            time.sleep(0.01)  # slight delay to reduce server strain

Example usage:

mc = Minecraft.create()

pos = mc.player.getTilePos()

build_blueprint(mc, pos.x, pos.y, pos.z, blueprint)

You can replace the example usage with a bot command handler or socket trigger.

This code assumes a local Minecraft Pi or modded Java environment with mcpi API.
